I built an advanced full-stack AI-powered web app designed to help users generate resumes, craft personalized cover letters, and take mock interview tests. The application is developed using React and Next.js for a dynamic and efficient front-end, styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for a modern and responsive user experience.

For authentication, the app integrates Clerk, ensuring seamless and secure user login and account management. The backend is powered by PostgreSQL and Prisma, providing a robust and scalable database solution. The app also utilizes Inngest for efficient background task execution, enabling smooth processing of AI-generated content.

At its core, the application leverages the Gemini API to power AI-driven features, allowing users to create high-quality, tailored resumes and cover letters in seconds. The mock interview feature simulates real interview scenarios, providing AI-generated questions and feedback to enhance user preparation.

This AI-driven platform streamlines career preparation by offering intelligent resume building, automated cover letter suggestions, and interactive mock interviews, all within a seamless and user-friendly interface. With secure authentication, efficient database management, and AI integration, this app serves as a powerful tool for job seekers looking to optimize their job applications and interview skills.
